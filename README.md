This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: passing extra parameters to a function that does not accept them. The code showcases the correct way to call a function with the expected number of parameters, along with an example of incorrect usage that leads to a compiler error.  The solution provides a corrected version, emphasizing the importance of matching function signatures when calling functions in Swift.
